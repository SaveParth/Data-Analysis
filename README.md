**Overview**

This repository contains an IPython notebook that performs data preprocessing and applies a regression model to predict diamond prices based on user input. The model achieves an accuracy of 86%.

**Features**

Data preprocessing steps including cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.

Implementation of a regression model for predicting diamond prices.

User input-based price prediction.

Model evaluation and accuracy assessment.


**Usage**

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Run the notebook step by step to preprocess the data and train the model.

Input custom diamond features to get a price prediction.
